# User-comments-Clustering-
This project aims to cluster user comments from various online platforms to uncover common themes, sentiments, and patterns. By leveraging NLP and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we can automatically categorize comments into clusters, facilitating easier moderation, sentiment analysis, and understanding of user feedback.
Goals: 
Automate Comment Categorization: Reduce manual effort in analyzing comments by categorizing them into predefined or dynamically generated clusters.
Sentiment Analysis: Determine the overall sentiment of comments within each cluster to gauge user satisfaction.
Trend Identification: Identify emerging trends and topics of discussion among users to inform content creation and product development strategies.
Technologies Used
Python: For scripting and automation.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and clustering algorithms.
NLTK/SpaCy: For natural language processing tasks.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
